# FREE TRELLIS 2023 2024 2025 🚀🎉
TRELLIS is an advanced model designed for generating high-quality 3D assets. It utilizes either text or image prompts to create a variety of 3D formats, including Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. At the heart of TRELLIS is a unique Structured LATent (SLAT) representation, which facilitates the decoding of different output formats. The model is powered by Rectified Flow Transformers specifically optimized for SLAT, enhancing its performance and versatility.

We offer robust pre-trained models with up to 2 billion parameters, trained on an extensive dataset of 500,000 diverse 3D objects. TRELLIS outperforms existing methods, including the latest advancements at comparable scales, by providing flexible options for output formats and enabling localized 3D editing capabilities—features that were previously unavailable in earlier models. This innovation not only enhances the quality and diversity of 3D asset generation but also streamlines the workflow for artists and developers, making it a significant advancement in the field of 3D modeling and design.
